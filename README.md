Problems/Issues I had:
1. I couldn't get the Particle System to be effected by when the Player Ship moves. If I set it to respond to one of the movement controls, the ship wouldn't move. Nothing else I did seemed to work. So, I made it so the Particles can be turned on and off by the player if they want them. 
2. You didn't specifiy what kind of file to make the README. So I made one on both my GitHub Reposistory, and a Text File in the .zip folder.
